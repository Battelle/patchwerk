#any line starting with # is a comment
#lines with a single word are assumed to be function names to look up in kallsyms
#any lines with 2 values are assumed to be a function name or physical offset with a hex length
#a 3rd value indicates t[ext] or d[ata] for what the area should be used for regardless of what kallsyms claims
#if the 2nd value is t[ext] or d[ata] then the field size is assumed to be whatever kallsyms indicates
#examples:
#a_function
#b_function 0x30
#b_function text
#a_function 0x20 d
#1ff00 30

#panic 0x500
inet6_hash_connect 0x600
